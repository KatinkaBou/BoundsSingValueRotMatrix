# BoundsSingValueRotMatrix
This repository includes a python code to compute for random nega-cyclic matrices their smallest and largest singular vaules for dimensions 2^i where i goes from 1 to 10.

We referred to this repository in an earlier version of our paper "Towards Classical Hardness of Module-LWE: The Linear Rank Case". The earlier version can be accessed via https://eprint.iacr.org/archive/2020/1020/1598495175.pdf. Note that since an update on the 16.03.2021, the lower bound on the smallest singular value is not needed anymore.
